# Intelligent Dynamic Parking Pricing System

An intelligent real-time parking price optimization system that leverages demand forecasting, traffic conditions, and competitive pricing strategies to dynamically compute and adjust parking prices across multiple city locations. This solution also incorporates **real-time streaming with Pathway**, and **interactive visualizations with Bokeh**.

## Project Overview

This system analyzes parking occupancy data across 14 major locations to compute **dynamic pricing in real-time**, using:

- Rolling occupancy & demand intensity
- Traffic & queue conditions
- Special events
- Competitor pricing strategies

It features:

✅ Predictive pricing  
✅ Competitive benchmarking  
✅ Real-time streaming & visualizations  
✅ Streamlit dashboard for exploration

### Feature Engineering

* Occupancy normalization (`Occupancy / Capacity`)
* Temporal features (`hour`, `is_weekend`)
* Demand features: `QueueLength`, `TrafficConditionNearby`, `VehicleType`, `IsSpecialDay`
* Rolling occupancy window: `occupancy_rolling_3h`
* Distance to closest lot
* Competitive metrics: `AvgCompPrice`, `NumCompetitors`


## Pricing Models

| Model Name        | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Price\_Model1** | Basic linear model without daily reset             |
| **Price\_Model2** | Linear model with reset every day                  |
| **Price\_Model3** | Demand-based pricing (queue, traffic, special day) |
| **Price\_Model4** | Competitive pricing (adjust based on nearby lots)  |

## Real-Time Streaming

The `Pathway` library powers the real-time computation pipeline. The final enriched dataframe is streamed and visualized using:

* `pw.Schema`: defines expected fields (e.g., price models, location)
* `DFSubject`: converts static data into a stream
* `windowby()`: daily aggregation of metrics
* `plot()`: Bokeh-based live plot per parking lot

**Streaming Rate**: 1000 rows/sec
**Total Records Processed**: \~18,000+

## Feature Engineering

Your function performs:

* Contextual encoding for `VehicleType`
* Time-aware features: `hour`, `is_weekend`
* Distance-based demand score (`closest_lot_distance`)
* Rolling occupancy demand proxy
* Normalization of queue and traffic
* Filtering invalid records & normalizing where necessary


Navigate to:

* **Introduction Tab**: View explanation, architecture
* **Streaming Panel**: Select pricing model & parking lot → view real-time trend
* **Map Heatmap**: Interactive heatmap of all locations

---

## Future Improvements

* Add anomaly detection to reroute logic
* Include pricing elasticity models using RL or XGBoost
* Integrate live occupancy feeds (IoT sensors or APIs)
* Export live alerts (e.g., high demand, surge pricing)

---

## Additional Notes

* **Data Source**: UrbanSmart Parking Dataset (CSV)
* **Input Rate**: Simulated using Pathway
* **Visualization**: Real-time Bokeh chart per parking lot
* **Limitations**: Performance bottleneck for larger windowed joins in competitive model
